1A)a.Call Back function: Call back is a function which will be executed after
executing one function. If a function is being executed,then call back function
will be the one which is to be executed next. Any function that is passed as an
argument to another function so that it can be executed in that other function
is called as a callback function.

b.Callback Hell: Callback Hell is nested
callbacks one below the other forming a pyramid structure. Every callback waits
for the previous callback. This pyramid structure affects the readability of the
Code.

2A)To iterate an object different methods can be used like: For loop,while
loop and do while loop can be used to iterate an object in javascript.
While loop: It executes a program with the given condition until its true. 
For example, i=1; 
while(i<=5)
{ console.log(i); i++ }
It repeats or iterates the elements until the condition is satisfied. 
Do while loop: It executes the
program without checking the condition is true or not. It executes the program
till where it is satisfied.
For example, i=0,
Do while(i<=1)
{ console.log(i);
i++ } 
For loop: This loop can be used to check the condition and repeat the
elements.
For example, for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) 
{ console.log(i); }
The
whole loop is executed in one statement with the help of a for loop. 

3A)Promise:
A promise can be of 3 types: -Pending -Reject -Complete Example: let promise=new
promise(resolve,reject)=> let a=10; 
let b=2;
let c=a/b; if(c>=0) resolve(c);
else reject("invalid data"); };

4A) Converting one data type to another is known
as coercion. For example,"2" is a string now but it can be converted into a
number by removing double quotes.It becomes 2 which is a number.

5A)Pass by
value: In Pass by value, function is called by directly passing the value of the
variable as an argument. So any changes made inside the function does not affect
the original value.
Pass by reference:In Pass by Reference, Function is called
by directly passing the address of the variable as an argument. So changing the
value inside the function also change the original value.

6A)Flexbox is one
dimensional while grid is two dimensional. Flexbox works on content while grid
works on layout. 

7A)Currying is defined as changing a function having multiple
arguments into a sequence of functions with a single argument. let multiply =
(a, b, c) => { return a * b * c; }
let multiply_curried = (a) => (b) => (c) => {
return a * b * c; } let res = multiply(1, 2, 3); console.log(res); 
let res2 =
multiply_curried(1)(2)(3); console.log(res2); 


8A)The way in which objects inherit properties from one another is known as prototype.

10A)Src attribute can be used in
this case when a script should be taken into another script box. With the help of src attribute data can be derived from different
script blocks. 

9A)Javascript is loosely typed whereas typescript is strongly
typed. Class is not there in Javascript whereas it exists in typescript.
